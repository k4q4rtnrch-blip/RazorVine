# RazorVine Jewellery Co.

RazorVine Jewellery Co. is an independent jewellery brand specialising in **custom-designed, handcrafted pieces**.

Every custom project starts with a conversation. I work directly with clients to design jewellery that reflects their ideas, style, and story — from initial concept to the finished piece.

Alongside bespoke commissions, RazorVine Jewellery Co. will also feature a selection of **ready-to-purchase jewellery projects**, available directly through the website when listed.
